## 📂 `root@kravchenko:~/` — Security Architect & Systems Engineer

I am a Cybersecurity and Systems Engineering student at the **Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology** in Warsaw. My technical methodology is built on a "security-first" mindset, integrating offensive tactics with robust architectural design. I focus on the intersection of **DevSecOps**, low-level systems programming, and secure infrastructure.
